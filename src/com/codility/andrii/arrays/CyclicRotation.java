/*
 * A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. 
 * Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right 
 * by one index, and the last element of the array is moved to the 
 * first place. For example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] 
 * is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements are shifted right by one index and 6 
 * is moved to the first place).

The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A 
will be shifted to the right K times.

Write a function:

class Solution { public int[] solution(int[] A, int K); }

that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers and an 
integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.

For example, given

    A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]
    K = 3
the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]. Three rotations were made:

    [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] -> [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
    [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] -> [7, 6, 3, 8, 9]
    [7, 6, 3, 8, 9] -> [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]
For another example, given

    A = [0, 0, 0]
    K = 1
the function should return [0, 0, 0]

Given

    A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    K = 4
the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4]

Assume that:

N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000..1,000].
In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution 
will not be the focus of the assessment.
